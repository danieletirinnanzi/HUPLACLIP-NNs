# type of correction to use (in graphs_generation.py):
# - p_increase (old correction): increasing the p value of the graph without the clique so that the average degree is matched between the two graphs
# - p_reduce (new correction): reducing the p value of the graph where the clique will be added
p_correction_type: p_reduce

testing_parameters:
  max_clique_size_proportion_test: 0.3  # set to 0.12 for N=1200
  num_test: 32  # number of graphs in each test iteration
  clique_testing_levels: 100  # number of different clique sizes to test (will be the number of datapoints in the test set)
  test_iterations: 5
