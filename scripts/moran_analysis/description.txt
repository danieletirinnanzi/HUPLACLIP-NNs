This code recapitulates the Moran analysis performed on human data. For each model, the code:
- loads the trained model
- presents it a batch of graphs only with the clique, contextually measuring the Moran's i
- performs this for a range of K values
- stores the results

The functions are implemented to be compatible with execution on a normal laptop (not on a cluster using DistributedDataParallel)
