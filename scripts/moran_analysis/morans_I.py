def morans_I_numba(adj_matrix, max_radius):
    """
    Calculates Moran's I spatial autocorrelation statistic for a square adjacency matrix
    using rook's case neighbors up to a given radius.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adj_matrix : np.ndarray
        Square (N x N) matrix representing an input graph.
    max_radius : int
        Maximum radius to consider for neighbor relationships.

    Returns
    -------
    I : np.ndarray
        Array of Moran's I values for each radius from 0 to max_radius.

    Notes
    -----
    - Uses rook's case (up, down, left, right) neighbors at each radius.
    - I is set to 0 when radius is 0 (I[0]=0).
    - Optimized with numba for performance.
